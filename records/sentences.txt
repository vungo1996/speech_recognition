to our american boys and girls is offered this volume which is really her best one
this edition is based on the hunt version with an introduction by the folk
the hunt version is considered a most accurate english translation
from the full collection fifty one stories suitable for children have been selected
among these are famous tales as well as many delightful ones not usually included in childrens volumes
where the hunt wording is too stilted the text of her has been followed
this book was first published on the twenty first of september and for its fiftieth anniversary edition a person suggested to me that it would be of interest to include in it some unpublished or little known illustrations by my father
since the writing is indeed a scrawl and very hard to read i set it out in print here
the text will be found to correspond with many differences to that in this book but if the bottom of the second side of the sheet was the end of the text the entire history related by the truth
they have the quality rare in fairy tales of actually illustrating their text
the hero could not creep in a hole that size not even when he was a young dragon certainly not after he had devoured so many maidens of the valley
the little black and white headings are particularly pretty and graceful in outline
therefore in this book a few other parts unsuitable for children have been omitted
the device at the top of the map apparently represents the points of the compass with the seven stars of the great bear in the north
on this she began to cry and cried louder and louder and could not be comforted
at the bottom on the right is the first actual sketch of the lonely mountain added in pencil
i am weeping for my golden ball which has fallen into the fountain
my brother recorded long after his recollection of the evenings when my father would stand with his back to the fire in his small study of the house and tell stories to my brothers and me
he said that he remembered with perfect clarity the occasion when my father said that he was going to start telling us a long story about a small being with furry feet and asked us what he should be called
he lives in the water with the other frogs and croaks and can be no companion to any human being
when half way through the journey of our life i found that i was in a gloomy wood because the path which led aright was lost
his opinion was that my father had written the opening sentence in the summer before he began telling us the story and that he repeated those opening words
she ran to see who was outside but when she opened the door there sat the frog in front of it
but in my fathers imagination i believe the two were visually one or little distinguished
this is only a sample of that extremely courteous but slightly desperate correspondence of half a century ago
i have only too much to say and much already written about the world into which the hero intruded
i should rather like an opinion other than that of my children whether it has any value in itself or as a marketable commodity
again and once again while they were on their way something cracked
thereÂ was once on a time an old goat who had seven little kids and loved them with all the love of a mother for her children
at that time the languages and letters were quite different from ours of today
at the time of this tale only the best made regular use of them especially for private or secret records
it was not long before some one knocked at the house door and cried
there is little or no magic about them except the ordinary everyday sort which helps them to disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me come blundering along making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off
that was of course absurd but certainly there was still something not entirely hero like about them and once in a while members of the hero clan would go and have adventures
by some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world when there was less noise and more green and the heroes were still numerous and prosperous
she took the kid out and it told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others
if you had heard only a quarter of what i have heard about him and i have only heard very little of all there is to hear you would be prepared for any sort of remarkable tale
at length in her grief she went out and the youngest kid ran with her
they embraced their dear mother and jumped like a tailor at his wedding
tales and adventures sprouted up all over the place wherever he went in the most extraordinary fashion
